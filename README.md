#  Training Pipeline for a Neural Network - PyTorch

This repository demonstrates a **basic pipeline to train a Neural Network using PyTorch**. It covers the foundational steps needed to go from raw data to a trained model using core PyTorch functionality.

## 📌 What's Included

- 📥 Loading the dataset  
- 🧹 Preprocessing: Removing unnecessary features and splitting into train/test sets  
- 🔁 Training loop:  
  - Forward propagation  
  - Loss calculation  
  - Weight and bias updates via **backpropagation** (`torch.autograd`)  
- 📊 Model evaluation

##

This is my **first repository introducing PyTorch**.  
I’ll be exploring more advanced and in-depth PyTorch workflows in upcoming repositories
